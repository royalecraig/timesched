# TimeSched ‚Äî Lightweight Task Scheduler

TimeSched is a minimal, cron-style Python scheduler that reads tasks from a simple text file (`schedule.txt`) and runs them at specified times.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚Äî Use With Caution

This script **executes commands automatically**, including system-level tasks. **Malicious or incorrect commands can damage your system.**  
Only use trusted `schedule.txt` files, and **review every command** you add.

---

## üìÅ Folder Structure

Expected layout:

```
/home/timesched/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ timesched.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schedule.txt
```

Make sure both files are inside `/home/timesched/` exactly.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Scheduler

**Basic (non-privileged tasks only):**
```bash
python3 /home/timesched/timesched.py
```

---

## üîê When Sudo Is Needed

If your `schedule.txt` includes commands like:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo clamscan
sudo rkhunter --check
```

Then you must either:

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Run as Root
```bash
sudo python3 /home/timesched/timesched.py
```

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Configure Passwordless Sudo (for specific tools)
To avoid password prompts every time, **you can grant passwordless rights to trusted commands only**:

Edit your sudoers config:
```bash
sudo visudo
```

Add:
```bash
yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt, /usr/bin/freshclam, /usr/bin/clamscan, /usr/bin/rkhunter
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual username.

---

## üöÄ Start at Boot with Cron

To auto-run at startup:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the line:

```cron
@reboot python3 /home/timesched/timesched.py
```

Make sure your user has permission to run the needed commands (see sudo advice above).

---

## üß™ Testing

You can manually test the scheduler by running:

```bash
python3 /home/timesched/timesched.py
```

It will check the schedule once per minute and run any matching commands.

---

## üì¶ Note

This project assumes a local `/home/timesched/` setup for simplicity. You may adapt it for other paths if needed.
